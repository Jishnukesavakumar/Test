Error- 'virtualenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.


Solution:
Create a new working directory for virtual environment and change to that(not part of solution, just a best practise)

C:\Python\section4>python3 -m venv venv



C:\Python\section4>venv\Scripts\activate
just type the above code and activate the venv
